## AI-Driven Visitor Demand Forecasting & Under-vibrancy Analysis for Fukui Prefecture

**PhD Research & Hokuriku Regional Tourism AI Governance Grant**

This repository contains a reproducible analysis pipeline for predicting daily visitor counts at Tojinbo (東尋坊), Fukui Prefecture, Japan, using AI camera data, JMA weather observations, Google Business Profile route-search intent, and Hokuriku-wide tourism surveys.

### Key Findings

| Finding | Value |
|---|---|
| OLS R² | 0.810 (Adj R² = 0.802) |
| RF 5-fold CV R² | 0.557 ± 0.131 |
| First-Difference R² (autocorrelation-corrected) | 0.708 |
| LDV R² / DW | 0.848 / 1.893 |
| #1 Predictor | Google `directions` (route search), r = +0.781 |
| Ishikawa → Tojinbo cross-prefectural signal | r = +0.537 |
| Visitors vs Satisfaction | r = +0.161 (p = 0.001) — NO overtourism |
| Lost Visitors (Opportunity Gap) | 85,512 |
| Winter weather sensitivity | 6.29× worse than summer |
| Under-vibrancy in low-satisfaction reviews | 11.4× more prevalent (6.2% vs 0.5%) |
| Fukui national visitor ranking | 47th / 47 prefectures (winter) |

### Data Sources

| Source | Description | Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| **AI Camera** (Tojinbo-Shotaro) | Daily person counts from edge-AI camera | 2024-12 → 2026-02 |
| **JMA** (Japan Meteorological Agency) | Hourly precip, temp, sun, wind | 2024-01 → 2026-02 |
| **Google Business Profile** | Daily route searches, map views, reviews for 47 Fukui tourism locations | 2024-01 → 2026-02 |
| **Hokuriku Tourism Survey** | 95,653 responses (satisfaction, NPS, free text) across Fukui/Ishikawa/Toyama | 2023 → 2026 |
