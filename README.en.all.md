[Visualization App Source Code](https://github.com/code4fukui/fukui-kanko-people-flow-visualization)

## Camera Locations

As of January 2025, AI cameras are installed at:
- Fukui Station East Entrance (Tourist Information)
- Tojinbo Shopping Street
- Rainbow Line Summit Park (Parking Lot 1 & 2)

*Please do not contact the locations directly regarding the cameras.*

## Directory Structure

- `full/`: Aggregated CSV data per location and detection target
- `monthly/`: Data aggregated by day (daily aggregates; organized by location, target, year, month)
- `daily/`: Data aggregated by hour (hourly aggregates; organized by location, target, year, month, day)
- `hourly/`: Data at 5-minute intervals (not hourly aggregates; organized by location, target, year, month, day, hour)
- `tools/`: TypeScript scripts for data aggregation and processing (run with Deno)

## Data Processing Tools

Scripts in the `tools/` directory (run with Deno):
- `aggregate-day.deno.ts`, `aggregate-hour.deno.ts`, `aggregate5mins.deno.ts`: Aggregate raw CSV data into daily, hourly, and 5-minute intervals
- `csv2sqlite.deno.ts`: Convert CSV data to SQLite databases
- `check-csv.deno.ts`: Validate CSV files for errors or warnings
- `escape-age-data.deno.ts`, `escape-movement-data.deno.ts`: Fix formatting issues in age and movement data
- `license-plate-aggregation.deno.ts`: Aggregate license plate data from parking lots
- `thin-out-to-one-second-interval.deno.ts`: Reduce movement data to one-second intervals

## Data Format

CSV files contain aggregated counts and attributes for detected objects (Person, Face, LicensePlate), including age, gender, prefecture, and movement.

# merged_survey_csv_py

Python scripts to standardize and merge tourism survey CSV data from Toyama, Ishikawa, and Fukui prefectures.

## Overview

This project converts survey data collected by three prefectures into a unified CSV schema, then merges the results into a single dataset and splits outputs by year.

## Features

- Standardize different CSV formats into one schema
- JSON-based column mapping for each prefecture
- Preprocessing for dates, line endings, and anonymized member IDs
- Automatic information source flag generation
- Merge outputs across prefectures
- Auto-download the latest public data
- Year-based file splitting
- Cleanup of old outputs before processing

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+

## Quick Start

Run the full pipeline (download, convert, merge, split):

```bash
python merge_survey.py
```

Run a single prefecture conversion:

```bash
python convert_toyama.py
python convert_ishikawa.py
python convert_fukui.py
```

Download data only:

```bash
python download_data.py
python download_data.py --toyama
python download_data.py --ishikawa
python download_data.py --fukui
```

```

For detailed developer notes, see [docs/development.md](docs/development.md).

## How It Works

1. Download the latest data for each prefecture.
2. Clean output directories.
3. Convert each dataset using JSON column mappings.
4. Generate flags for information sources.
5. Merge all converted rows into a single CSV.
6. Split merged and per-prefecture outputs by year.

## Data Details

### Standardized Schema

The unified output includes fields for:

- Demographics (residence, gender, age, occupation, income)
- Accommodation (area, nights, meals)
- Transportation modes and ratings
- Visit frequency
- Purpose and activity flags
- Information source flags
- Spending categories
- Satisfaction and feedback
- Additional metadata (consent, location, user agent)

### Information Source Flags

Flags are generated when the source text includes known keywords, for example:

- Facebook, Google, Google Maps, Instagram, TikTok
- X (formerly Twitter), YouTube, social media ads
- Blog, roundup sites, internet or app
- Digital news, booking websites, accommodation
- TV or radio, newspaper or magazine
- Travel agencies, friends or acquaintances, local people
- Tourism pamphlets or posters
- Tourist information centers, fairs or exhibitions
- DMO or tourism association websites, other

## Output Files

- Per-prefecture converted files under output/<prefecture>/
- Merged files under output_merge/
- Each output is split by year (for example, 2023-2026)
- Full merged files can exceed 50MB and are not pushed to GitHub

## GitHub Actions

The workflow in .github/workflows/run_python.yml runs daily at 06:00 JST to:

1. Download the latest data
2. Convert and merge
3. Split files by year
4. Push year-split outputs

## Notes

- Input CSV files must be UTF-8 encoded.
- Column mapping JSON files must be valid JSON.
- Output directories are created automatically.
- Large files (full merged outputs) are ignored via .gitignore.
